# Architecture Documentation Migration

## Overview

The monolithic `architecture.md` file has been split into focused, domain-specific documents for better maintainability and navigation.

## Migration Summary

### Original File
- **Location:** `docs/architecture.md` (backed up as `docs/architecture-original-backup.md`)
- **Size:** ~1,900 lines covering all architectural concerns
- **Issue:** Single file became difficult to navigate and maintain

### New Structure
**Location:** `docs/architecture/`

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `README.md` | Architecture overview and navigation | ~80 |
| `01-system-overview.md` | High-level architecture and principles | ~200 |
| `02-tech-stack.md` | Technology selection with rationale | ~300 |
| `03-data-models.md` | TypeScript interfaces and business entities | ~400 |
| `04-database-schema.md` | PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies | ~350 |
| `05-api-specification.md` | REST API endpoints and Colombian integration | ~450 |
| `06-frontend-architecture.md` | React/Next.js patterns and state management | ~400 |
| `07-infrastructure.md` | Epic 1 implementation and deployment | ~350 |
| `08-colombian-integration.md` | Colombian market-specific features | ~400 |

### Benefits of New Structure

1. **Focused Documents** - Each file covers a single architectural domain
2. **Easier Navigation** - Clear file names and comprehensive README
3. **Better Maintainability** - Smaller files are easier to edit and review
4. **Team Collaboration** - Multiple people can work on different architectural areas
5. **Colombian Integration** - Dedicated file for market-specific requirements

### Migration Impact

- **No Breaking Changes** - All architectural information preserved
- **Enhanced Organization** - Better logical grouping of related concepts
- **Improved Searchability** - Domain-specific files easier to find and reference
- **Future-Proof** - Structure supports additional architectural documents

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- **Start with:** `docs/architecture/README.md` for overview and navigation
- **Implementation:** Use `07-infrastructure.md` for Epic 1 setup
- **API Integration:** Reference `05-api-specification.md` for endpoints
- **Database Work:** Check `04-database-schema.md` for schema details

### For Architects
- **System Design:** Review `01-system-overview.md` for architectural principles
- **Technology Decisions:** See `02-tech-stack.md` for technology rationale
- **Colombian Requirements:** Study `08-colombian-integration.md` for market specialization

### For Product Managers
- **Business Context:** Read `01-system-overview.md` and `08-colombian-integration.md`
- **Data Models:** Review `03-data-models.md` for business entity definitions
- **API Capabilities:** Check `05-api-specification.md` for feature endpoints

## File Cross-References

The new architecture documents include proper cross-references:
- README contains navigation links to all documents
- Each document references related documents where appropriate
- Colombian integration concepts are cross-referenced throughout

## Backup and Recovery

- **Original File:** Backed up as `docs/architecture-original-backup.md`
- **Reversible:** Original content can be restored if needed
- **Versioned:** All changes tracked in git history
