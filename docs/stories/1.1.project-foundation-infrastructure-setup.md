## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context

This story establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Colombian Appointment Management System based on the comprehensive fullstack architecture. The implementation must strictly follow the modular monolithic architecture pattern deployed as serverless functions via Vercel with TypeScript-based fullstack using Next.js.

[Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
**Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety across frontend/backend
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ via Supabase with São Paulo region deployment
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for rapid UI development
**Deployment:** Vercel platform with automatic GitHub integration
**State Management:** Zustand 4.4+ (to be implemented in later stories)
**Authentication:** Supabase Auth 2.0+ with JWT tokens and RLS integration

### Project Structure Definition

The monorepo structure must follow this exact organization:
```
appointments-demo/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                    # Next.js 14+ application
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── app/           # App Router structure
│       │   ├── components/    # Shared components
│       │   ├── lib/          # Utilities
│       │   └── types/        # TypeScript definitions
│       └── package.json
├── packages/
│   ├── types/                # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── utils/               # Colombian utilities
│   └── ui/                  # Shared UI components
└── package.json            # Workspace root
```

[Source: architecture.md#epic-1-infrastructure-architecture]

### Database Schema Requirements

The businesses table must be created with Colombian market specializations:
- Colombian phone number validation with CHECK constraint for +57 XXX XXX XXXX format
- Colombian address structure with street, city, department fields
- WhatsApp number field with same validation as business phone
- Settings JSONB field with default Colombian configurations (timezone: "America/Bogota", currency: "COP")
- Row Level Security policies for complete multi-tenant isolation

[Source: architecture.md#core-tables-businesses]

### Colombian Utility Functions Specifications

Must implement these exact functions in packages/utils/src/colombian/:
1. `formatColombianPhone(phone: string): string` - Format to +57 XXX XXX XXXX
2. `validateColombianPhone(phone: string): boolean` - Validate format with regex
3. `formatPesoCOP(amount: number): string` - Format using Intl.NumberFormat with 'es-CO' locale
4. `COLOMBIAN_DEPARTMENTS` constant - Array of all 32 Colombian departments

[Source: architecture.md#core-colombian-market-functions]

### Environment Configuration Requirements

Must configure these environment variables:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY for client
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for server operations
- COLOMBIA_TIMEZONE: 'America/Bogota'
- COLOMBIA_CURRENCY: 'COP'
- COLOMBIA_PHONE_PREFIX: '+57'

[Source: architecture.md#environment-configuration]

### Health Check Implementation

The /api/health endpoint must return:
```typescript
{
  status: 'healthy',
  timestamp: ISO string,
  services: {
    database: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy',
    supabase: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy'
  },
  version: string,
  environment: string
}
```

Include database connectivity test via Supabase client connection to businesses table.

[Source: architecture.md#health-check-endpoint-implementation]

### Multi-Tenant Security Implementation

Row Level Security policies must be implemented for businesses table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE businesses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY businesses_isolation_policy ON businesses
    FOR ALL USING (id = current_setting('app.current_business_id')::UUID);
```

This ensures complete business data isolation at the database level.

### Testing

#### Testing Requirements from Architecture

**Frontend Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
**Backend Testing:** Jest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
**Location:** Tests should be co-located with implementation files using .test.ts/.test.tsx extensions

**Required Test Coverage:**
- Colombian utility functions validation and formatting
- Health check endpoint response structure
- Supabase client configuration and connection
- Environment configuration loading
- Multi-tenant RLS policy enforcement

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest 29+ for all testing
- React Testing Library 14+ for component tests
- Supertest 6+ for API endpoint tests
- Use TypeScript for all test files
