## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context

This story implements the Colombian business registration system as the entry point for multi-tenant business onboarding. The registration must capture Colombian-specific business information including proper address structure (departments not states), Colombian phone validation, and WhatsApp integration as primary communication channel.

[Source: PRD - Epic 1: Foundation & Business Registration]

### Database Schema Requirements

The businesses table is already implemented with Colombian market specializations:
- Colombian phone number validation with CHECK constraint for +57 XXX XXX XXXX format
- Colombian address structure with street, city, department fields (not states/provinces)
- WhatsApp number field with same validation as business phone
- Settings JSONB field with default Colombian configurations (timezone: "America/Bogota", currency: "COP")
- Row Level Security policies for complete multi-tenant isolation
- Email uniqueness constraint to prevent duplicate registrations

[Source: architecture/04-database-schema.md#businesses]

### Component Architecture and File Organization

Frontend components follow feature-based organization with Colombian-specific business logic:

**Component Structure:**
```
apps/web/src/
├── app/
│   └── (auth)/
│       └── register/
│           └── business/
│               └── page.tsx      # Business registration page
├── components/
│   ├── business/
│   │   └── registration-form.tsx  # Main registration form
│   ├── colombian/
│   │   ├── phone-input.tsx        # Colombian phone formatting
│   │   └── address-input.tsx      # Colombian address with departments
│   └── forms/
│       └── validation-schemas.ts   # Zod validation schemas
```

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

### Colombian Phone Input Implementation

The ColombianPhoneInput component must implement auto-formatting as users type:
- Remove non-digit characters during input
- Auto-format to +57 XXX XXX XXXX when 10 digits entered
- Validate using regex: `/^\+57 [0-9]{3} [0-9]{3} [0-9]{4}$/`
- Provide placeholder: "Ej: +57 300 123 4567"

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#colombian-specific-input-components]

### Colombian Departments Data

The address form must include a dropdown with all 32 Colombian departments:
- Administrative divisions specific to Colombian government structure
- Departments not states/provinces (matches Colombian government structure)
- Required for proper address validation and holiday calendar integration

[Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#colombian-market-specializations]

### Multi-Tenant Security Implementation

Business registration must establish proper tenant isolation:
- UUID identifier generation for business_id (tenant isolation)
- Row Level Security policy: `businesses_isolation_policy`
- Business context set in localStorage: `current_business_id`
- JWT tokens include business_id for automatic tenant context

[Source: architecture/04-database-schema.md#multi-tenant-security-design]

### API Endpoint Implementation

The registration endpoint `/api/business/register` must:
- Accept POST requests with business registration data
- Validate all fields using Zod schemas with Colombian business rules
- Check email uniqueness against businesses table
- Create business record with proper UUID and default Colombian settings
- Return success with business data or validation errors with Spanish messages
- Set business context for immediate dashboard access

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#api-service-layer]

### Validation Schema Requirements

Business validation must use Zod schemas matching TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
const ColombianPhoneSchema = z.string().regex(
  /^\+57 \d{3} \d{3} \d{4}$/,
  'Formato de teléfono colombiano inválido'
)

const BusinessRegistrationSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'El nombre es requerido'),
  email: z.string().email('Email inválido'),
  phone: ColombianPhoneSchema,
  whatsapp_number: ColombianPhoneSchema,
  // Colombian address structure
})
```

[Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#validation-schemas]

### Spanish Error Messages

All form validation must provide clear error messages in Colombian Spanish:
- "El nombre es requerido"
- "Email inválido"  
- "Formato de teléfono colombiano inválido"
- "Este email ya está registrado"
- "Seleccione un departamento"

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#colombian-market-specializations]

### Navigation Flow

Registration success must redirect to business dashboard with proper business context:
- Set business context in Zustand store
- Store business_id in localStorage for API calls
- Redirect to /dashboard with authenticated business session
- Enable immediate access to business features

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
