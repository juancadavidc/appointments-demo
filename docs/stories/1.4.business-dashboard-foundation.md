## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context

This story implements the main business dashboard that serves as the central hub for Colombian business owners to view their business profile, track setup progress, and navigate to all system sections. The dashboard must integrate seamlessly with the authentication system from Story 1.3 and leverage the business registration data from Story 1.2.

[Source: PRD - Epic 1: Foundation & Business Registration, Story 1.4]

### Previous Story Integration

**Authentication System Integration:** This dashboard leverages the complete authentication system implemented in Story 1.3, including the AuthProvider context, business context management, ProtectedRoute component, and RLS database context setting. The dashboard will be protected and automatically receive business context from the authenticated user session.

**Business Registration Data:** The dashboard displays and allows editing of business information captured in Story 1.2, including Colombian address structure (street, city, department), Colombian phone formatting (+57 XXX XXX XXXX), and business settings with Colombian timezone defaults.

**Database Utilities:** The dashboard uses the RLS context management system and business database operations implemented in previous stories for secure multi-tenant data access.

[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record - Tasks 3.2, 3.3, 4.5, and Story 1.2 completion notes]

### Dashboard Component Architecture

**Layout Structure:** The dashboard follows Next.js App Router patterns with a business layout that includes a sidebar navigation for desktop and hamburger menu for mobile. The layout integrates with the existing protected route system and business context validation.

**Component Organization:** Dashboard components are organized in the `/app/(business)/dashboard/` route with shared business components in `/components/business/` and Colombian-specific components in `/components/colombian/` following the established project structure.

**Business Layout Integration:** The dashboard uses the BusinessLayout pattern with BusinessSidebar navigation, ColombianHolidayBanner for holiday notifications, and business context provided by the AuthProvider.

### Colombian Market Specializations

**Phone Number Display:** All phone numbers must be displayed using Colombian formatting (+57 XXX XXX XXXX) with validation using the formatColombianPhone utility. Phone editing forms must include real-time formatting and validation feedback.

**Currency Formatting:** All pricing and financial information must be displayed using Colombian peso formatting with the formatPesoCOP utility. Dashboard should use proper COP currency symbols and formatting for any cost displays.

**Address Structure:** Business address editing must support Colombian department structure (not states/provinces) with proper validation using the validateColombianDepartment utility and COLOMBIAN_DEPARTMENTS constant.

**Timezone Handling:** Business settings must default to "America/Bogota" timezone with proper Colombian timezone handling for appointment scheduling context.

### Business Data Models

**Business Entity:** The dashboard displays and edits Business entity data with complete multi-tenant isolation using business_id. Business interface includes id, name, email, phone, address (BusinessAddress), whatsapp_number, and settings (BusinessSettings).

**Business Settings:** Dashboard must provide editing for BusinessSettings including timezone, currency (COP), booking_buffer_minutes, cancellation_policy_hours, working_days, and holiday_calendar_enabled.

**Setup Progress Tracking:** Dashboard tracks completion status of specialists (many), services (many), working hours configuration, and business profile completeness for setup progress indicators.

[Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#business-entity]

### Database Operations and RLS Context

**RLS Policy Integration:** All business data queries must respect Row Level Security policies that filter by current_setting('app.current_business_id')::UUID. Dashboard must use the BusinessContextDatabase utilities for safe database operations.

**Business Context Validation:** Dashboard must validate business context is properly set before any database operations and use the RLS context management system from Story 1.3 for business context setting and validation.

**Business Profile Updates:** Profile editing must use the business database utilities with proper business context validation to ensure users can only edit their own business data.

[Source: architecture/04-database-schema.md#businesses, Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record - Task 3.2, 3.4]

### State Management and Real-time Updates

**Zustand Store Integration:** Dashboard uses Zustand for business state management with persistence and integration with Supabase real-time subscriptions for business data changes.

**Business Store Pattern:** Create or enhance business store to manage current business profile, setup progress state, and business settings with proper TypeScript interfaces and real-time synchronization.

**Real-time Business Updates:** Dashboard should integrate with Supabase real-time subscriptions to update business profile display when business data changes in other sessions or components.

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

### File Structure and Component Location

**Route Structure:** Dashboard page located at `apps/web/src/app/(business)/dashboard/page.tsx` with corresponding test file `apps/web/src/app/(business)/dashboard/page.test.tsx`.

**Component Organization:** Business-specific components in `apps/web/src/components/business/` (business-profile-card, setup-progress, quick-actions) and Colombian components in `apps/web/src/components/colombian/` (holiday-banner, peso-display).

**Utility Functions:** Colombian utilities in `packages/utils/src/colombian/` for phone formatting, peso formatting, and department validation. Business database utilities in `apps/web/src/lib/database-operations.ts`.

[Source: architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

### API Integration and Business Context

**API Service Layer:** Dashboard uses the fetch interceptor system from Story 1.3 that automatically adds Authorization Bearer tokens and X-Business-ID headers for all authenticated API requests.

**Business Context Headers:** All API calls from dashboard components automatically include business context through the fetchWithAuth interceptor, ensuring proper multi-tenant isolation for business profile operations.

**Error Handling:** Dashboard must handle authentication errors (401) and business context errors (403) using the error handling patterns established in the authentication system.

[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record - Task 2.3, 2.5, architecture/06-frontend-architecture.md#api-service-layer]

### Setup Progress and Business Configuration

**Setup Progress Calculation:** Dashboard calculates setup completion based on business having at least one active specialist, at least one service configured, and working hours defined. Progress indicators show percentage completion and next steps.

**Quick Actions:** Dashboard provides shortcuts to add specialists and services, linking to future Epic 2 stories. Quick actions should handle cases where these features are not yet implemented by showing "Coming Soon" placeholders.

**Business Metrics:** Dashboard shows basic business statistics like total specialists, total services, and upcoming appointments when available, using proper Colombian peso formatting for any pricing information.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Frameworks:** Jest 29+ for all testing with React Testing Library 14+ for component tests and TypeScript for all test files. Tests should be co-located with implementation files using .test.tsx extensions.

**Component Testing:** Dashboard components must have comprehensive tests covering business context integration, Colombian data formatting, responsive design, and user interactions.

**Integration Testing:** Dashboard page must have integration tests covering complete authentication flow, business context validation, and real-time data updates.

**Colombian Data Testing:** All Colombian-specific functionality must be tested with real Colombian data including phone numbers, addresses, and peso formatting.

[Source: architecture/02-tech-stack.md#development--testing]

### Spanish Language Interface

**User Interface Language:** All dashboard text, labels, buttons, and messages must be in Spanish using Colombian business-friendly terminology. Form validation messages and error handling must use clear Spanish feedback.

**Colombian Business Context:** Dashboard interface should use Colombian business terminology and provide help text appropriate for Colombian service business owners.

**Accessibility Requirements:** Dashboard must meet WCAG AA accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for Colombian users with disabilities.
